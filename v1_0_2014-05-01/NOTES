VERSION 1.2 NOTES, BUG FIXES, AND CHANGE LOG

April 30, 2014:

There is still a major bug in pTime.c, which is mainly due to the unit conversions. 
Also, convergence checking procedures need an update, because we need to check
the norm of F vectors before entering the main calculation. We need to make this 
change to reflect this.

[12:30PM PDT] - "writeF" and "readF" routines in "fileIO" module added
[12:32PM PDT] - Fr and Fv vectors in pTime.c are now freed at the end of program to accommodate the output of F vectors to a file
[01:07PM PDT] - Added a new conditional statement for convergence by checking F(k) (NO NEED TO STORE F HISTORY! GO AHEAD AND
                DELETE THE ROUTINES!)
[01:39PM PDT] - Set the main unit systems for each vector set: Fr in Angstroms, rTilde in SI, XNext in Angstroms. Changes are made
                in "calcXtR" and "calcXNext" methods to reflect the defined unit systems.
[01:43PM PDT] - Changed "writeTraj" method to "write" the output instead of "append" the output.
[02:08PM PDT] - Changed the outputing procedures in pTime.c. Now the code outputs EVERY TIME. When the iteration converges, the latest
                output set is used later on in the pTime workflow. Done with pTime.c, testing pending!!
