PROGRAM NAME: sPV_AIMD.c
VERSION: 1.0 (Last updated - April 28, 2014)

DESCRIPTION: This program performs a one-step velocity verlet algorithm for updating velocities.
             The new velocities are outputted in a proprietary .trajt format, and the trajectory
             file (.traj) is also created. (A PROPERTIES FILE WILL BE OUTPUTTED IN THE FUTURE
             ITERATION AS WELL)

OPTIONS: -N, total number of particles
         -I, the MD iteration counter, passed from the shell script loop
         -P, the path to the current working directory
         -K, the sum of kinetic energy of the previous steps (for temperature calculation)
         -l, boolean value for 'isLastStep' ("True" or "False" only)
