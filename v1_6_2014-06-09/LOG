[JUNE 9, 2014]

Main Objectives for v1.6:

   - Correcting the masses to reflect the single concerning isotope only. The current version 
     concerns with the "average isotope masses", and might not give an accurate result
   - Unit corrections for the beginning - from the XYZ reading step to serial AIMD calculations.
     In this version everything is now in atomic units, and no further conversions are needed.
   - Initial code with preconditioner without passing arguments - hard-coding the theory to
     separate files. [I KNOW THIS IS NOT A GOOD PRACTICE, BUT WILL CHANGE LATER ON]
