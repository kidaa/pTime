[JUNE 5, 2014]

Main Objectives for v1.5:

   - Addressing the "NaN" problem while approximating the Hessian
   - When rDiff (check at every step) is lower than the set level of tolerance,
     use another steps to update the Hessian instead. If all rDiff is converged,
     simply use Hr = 0 and don't update anything!
   - Add -t option for pTime.c for tolerance.
   - The complied programs are in $PTIMEDIR/bin/v1_5_2014-06-05
