CHANGE LOG - MAY 21, 2014

pTime.c

[1] - Printing command line inputs to see if the program has correct values [12:55PM].
RESULT: Everything is correct!

[2] - Check if there are "NaN" values in Fv [1:05PM].
RESULT: No "NaN" values in Fv - the velocities seems to read correctly.

[3] - Check XNext value after calcXNext [2:15PM].
RESULT: XNext is correct only at X[0], the rest are "NaN" like what was outputted.

[4] - Check rTilde and vTilde [2:22PM].
RESULT: vTilde is completely "NaN", while rTilde is valid at only the first copy and the rest are "NaN".


PROBLEM NARROWED DOWN!!
Error is possibly lie in the calculation step or history step. Even when initialize rTilde and vTilde to zero, still give the same result!
Have to check the calculation and unit conversion carefully. Fr and Fv don't seem to have problems...

[UPDATE 1] - Problem is confined in calcTilde!! Still don't know where... Somehow rTilde & vTilde are transformed to "NaN" for some reason...
[UPDATE 2] - The problem is very likely associated with wrong Hr calculation... Have to track "calcHr" function VERY CAREFULLY!!
[UPDATE 3] - The problem is "division by zero" inside "calcHr" because the history vectors essentially store the same numbers, so the differences
             are zero, which leads to a calculation that is not feasible; thus, gives us "NaN" result.
[UPDATE 4] - Changed the first history storage mechanism in "arrayManip" to neglect the initial coordinate. Now the code gives a more reasonable
             result, but still have to check against regular AIMD and might need to ask corresponding people for verification.

BUT YEAH, CONSIDER IT DONE!!!
