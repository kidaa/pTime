Main Objectives for v1.9:

   - Improving performance by moving everything to dtemp and then move files at the later step
   - Remove the "dtpath" argument in writeNW function on fileIO.c and fileIO.h. Please note that the changes are made in all other
     executables involving writeNW

Files affected:

   all the files relating to I/O with focus on AIMD-related code first
